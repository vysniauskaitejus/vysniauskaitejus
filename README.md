👋 Hi, I’m @vysniauskaitejus
- 🌍 I'm passionate about constantly learning, whether it's diving into the world of science, mastering new languages like Spanish and Italian, or picking up a book that expands my horizons.
- 💻 Currently growing my knowledge in computer science, and always excited to explore new technologies and solve problems with code.
- 🏔️ When I’m not geeking out over tech, you’ll probably find me hiking up a mountain, running, or smashing a tennis ball. I love staying active and discovering new places on foot.
- 📚 My ideal day? A mix of outdoor adventures and getting lost in a good book. I believe that the best learning comes from both experiences and stories.
- ⚡ I can drive a tractor! 🚜 (Yup, I’ve got some skills both on and off-road!).
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her.
